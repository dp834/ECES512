For the system you chose as your project do:
1. Determine stability
2. Determine Controllability; If not controllable - add inputs to make it controllable.
3. Determine Observability; If not observable - add sensors to make it observable .
4. Decide upon and explain what is the desired closed loop behavior you wish in terms of: stability, transient, steady state error;
5. Choose the desired closed loop poles to achieve the required stability and transients in 4.
6. Design the linear state feedback to realize your design and find Nbar (DC gain) for the desired steady state error.
7. Demonstrate your design in MATLAB. Show that your design meets the objectives in 4.
8. Use the above to design and demonstrate OUTPUT FEEDBACK control and compare with STATE FEEDBACK.
